1. [LINUX SUCKS 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtJ9T_IJOPE&t=87s) <br>
   My first ever video watched around OS and it's really inspiring me to learn more because it really is a story of the rise and fall of LINUX. <br>

2. [osp4diss Website](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/osp-115.html) <br>
   Really comprehensive source of information for OS and other topics. 

3. [Linux For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTfQ-q6MPU) <br>
   Must-see video for new or advanced Linux users because it covers the fundamentals.
